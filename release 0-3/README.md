# Sherpa-BLOCKhead Version 0.3

This is an alternate toolhead for the Voron V0.1 using the [Mini-Sherpa](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Sherpa_Mini-Extruder) extruder.
This will fit on the stock V0.1 carriage.     
The goal of this project is to have a gantry that fits the Voron 0.1 with a Sherpa mini extruder and provides removable fan ducts so that the hotend is more serviceable.   
We are still at a very early development stage. If you use it, feedback is welcomed.
